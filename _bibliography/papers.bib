  abstract={Crowdsourcing is a way to solve problems that need human contribution. Crowdsourcing platforms distribute replicated tasks to workers, pay them for their contribution, and aggregate answers to produce a reliable conclusion. A fundamental problem is to infer a correct answer from the set of returned results. Another challenge is to obtain a reliable answer at a reasonable cost: unlimited budget allows hiring experts or large pools of workers for each task but a limited budget forces to use resources at best. Last, crowdsourcing platforms have to detect and ban malevolent users (a.k.a. spammers) to achieve good accuracy of their answers. This paper considers crowdsourcing of simple boolean tasks. We first define a probabilistic inference technique, that considers difficulty of tasks and expertise of workers when aggregating answers. We then propose CrowdInc, a greedy algorithm that reduces the cost needed to reach a consensual answer. CrowdInc distributes resources dynamically to tasks according to their difficulty. The algorithms solves batches of simple tasks in rounds that estimate workers expertize, tasks dificulty, and synthesize a plausible aggregated conclusion and a confidence score using Expectation Maximization. The synthesized values are used to decide whether more workers should be hired to increase confidence in synthesized answers. We show on several benchmarks that CrowdInc achieves good accuracy, reduces costs, and we compare its performance to existing solutions. We then use the estimation of CrowdInc to detect spammers, and study the impact of spammers on costs and accuracy.}

  abstract = {Crowdsourcing uses human intelligence to solve tasks which are still difficult for machines. Tasks at existing crowdsourcing platform are batches of relatively simple microtasks. However,
  real-world problems are often more difficult than micro-tasks. They require data collection, organization, pre-processing, analysis, and synthesis of results. In this thesis, we study how to specify
  complex crowdsourcing tasks and realize them with the helpof existing crowdsourcing platforms. The first contribution of this thesis is a complex workflows model that provides high-level constructs to
  describe a complex task through orchestration of simpler tasks. We provide algorithms to check termination and correctness of a complex workflow for a subset of the language (these questions are undecidable
  in the general case). A well-known drawback of crowdsourcing is that human answers might be wrong. To leverage this problem, crowdsourcing platforms replicate tasks, and forge a final trusted answer out of
  the produced results. Replication increases quality of data, but it is costly. The second contribution of this thesis is a set of aggregation techniques where merging of answers is realized using Expectation Maximization, and replication of tasks is performed online after considering the confidence
  estimated for aggregated data. Experimental results show that these techniques allow to aggregate the returned answers while achieving a good trade-off between cost and data quality,
  both for the realization of a batches of microtasks, and of complex workflow. }
