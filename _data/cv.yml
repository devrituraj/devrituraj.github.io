  - I am passionate about training large language and multimodal models, with a strong focus on Generative AI and its applications in reasoning systems, virtual assistants, and more recently, agentic frameworks. I'm deeply fascinated by the ability of these models to understand, reason, and interact intelligently. My current interests also lie in making these powerful models more accessible and efficient by optimizing them for edge deployment through techniques such as distillation and pruning. With over 6 years of industry experience, I am driven to advance the frontiers of AI and deep learning. Broadly, my research spans Generative AI, multimodal models, and natural language processing, within the wider fields of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science.
  - During my PhD, I focused on problems related to crowdsourcing, primarily developing formal models for complex workflows in data collection and task execution, and applying probabilistic techniques and latent variable models to analyze and optimize them.
