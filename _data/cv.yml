- title: Research Areas
  type: list
  contents:
  - My research focuses on developing algorithms for machine learning, mainly focused on semi-supervised learning, bayesian learning, and probabilistic models.
  - My PhD research focus was on developing algorithms for crowdsourcing applications, to propose formal model for complex workflows for crowdsourcing, develop algorithms by applying probabilistic based techniques and latent variable models.
  - I have also worked on machine learning methods for sensor data, to detect outliers and studying the impact of anamoly on classification problems.
  - My area of interest are Machine Learning, Bayesian Learning, Deep Learning, Human-in-the-loop AI, Crowdsourcing, and Workflows.
